done:
implemented basic perisstant datastructures like
insetion and searching btees, hashtables, bitmap for allocations, and a storage manager
basic classes implemented but have some issues of memory/storage wastage.
int main menu driven for manual testing

to implement:
combine the datastructures to make efficient database.
use that for recommendatoin engine
use free api or dataset for population
add hashtables in the mix for maybe caching or generate keys.
deletion in btrees that handles all the edgecases
performance and storage optimizations for efficiency
